# Styling-React-Components-New-Project  
## Day 21  
After taking as granted a new project i will be focusing now on how to set dynamic inline styles to my components. This method although is not advised but i will be testing it so that i get to know how it is done. In my new file CourseInput.js i will add styling on the label and input so that when i make an empty entry the background color of my text and label changes so that to give the user information that it is empty. My file then transforms like this ![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90603989/163435104-5a2215cc-c539-428d-a632-6b74e97c217c.png)  
Now in order to set css classes dynamically i will work on the CourseInput.js file. I can use a template literal by implementing backticks. This allows me to construct a string because whatever is typed between backticks is treated as a string. With this simple syntax i can dynamically add or remove classes. ' ` css class ${} `'. My file then transforms to this
